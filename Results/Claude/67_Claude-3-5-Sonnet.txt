Let me analyze who should act next for this request:

1. Opening a '.nid' file requires AFM image capture/control - this is handled by AFM_Handler
2. After the file is opened, we'll need to process and analyze the image to count objects - this is Data_Handler's task

Since the first step is opening the file, we should start with:

AFM_Handler

I apologize, but I need to inform you that I'm unable to find specific code for analyzing the number of distinct objects in a .nid file. This appears to be a limitation in the current tools available. The Document_Retriever doesn't contain image analysis code, and the basic AFM control code we have access to doesn't include object detection capabilities.

NEED HELP: We need assistance with:
1. Opening and reading the .nid file data
2. Image processing capabilities to detect and count distinct objects

This task requires additional image processing tools or libraries that aren't currently available in our toolset. Would you like to:
1. Just open the file for viewing (which we can do)
2. Consider using external image processing tools
3. Modify the request to focus on other AFM operations we can perform?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
