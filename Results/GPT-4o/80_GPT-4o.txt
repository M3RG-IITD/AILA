The optimized P, I, and D gains have been found using a genetic algorithm with baseline correction:

- P gain: \(208.511002\)
- I gain: \(6622.75819\)
- D gain: \(0.0114374817\)

Next, we will proceed to adjust the image size to \(100 \, \text{nm} \times 100 \, \text{nm}\) and update the AFM software with these optimized gains. Since I don't have direct access to the AFM software's settings, I will provide instructions for you to manually update the values. 

### Instructions to Update AFM Software:

1. **Access the AFM Software Settings:**
   - Open the configuration or settings menu in your Nanosurf AFM software.

2. **Update the Gain Values:**
   - Locate the section for tuning or setting the PID gains.
   - Update the P gain to \(208.511002\).
   - Update the I gain to \(6622.75819\).
   - Update the D gain to \(0.0114374817\).

3. **Adjust Image Size:**
   - Find the imaging or scan area settings in the software.
   - Set the scan size to \(100 \, \text{nm} \times 100 \, \text{nm}\).

4. **Save the Changes:**
   - Ensure that you save and apply the new settings before starting the scan.

Once these settings are applied, you can proceed with scanning your sample. If you need further assistance with any specific step, feel free to ask!
