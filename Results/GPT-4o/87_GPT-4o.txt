('user', "Open the file 'Sample.nid,' extract the Z-axis forward image data, and plot two line profiles: one vertical and one horizontal across the image. Save the plot as 'question_107_gpt4o.png.'")

The task involves opening a file, extracting image data, and plotting line profiles. Since the AFM_Handler is used for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, and the Data_Handler is responsible for handling data processing tasks, the Data_Handler should act next to perform these actions. Let's proceed with the Data_Handler.

I don't have direct access to open files or process data, but I can guide you through the steps you would take to accomplish this task using Python:

1. **Open and Read the File:**
   - Use a library like `nidata` to read the `.nid` file and extract the Z-axis forward image data.

2. **Extract the Image Data:**
   - Access the relevant Z-axis data from the file structure.

3. **Plot the Line Profiles:**
   - Utilize `matplotlib` to plot the line profiles. Extract data for both a horizontal and a vertical line across the image.

4. **Save the Plot:**
   - Save the plot as 'question_107_gpt4o.png'.

If you have a Python environment set up, you can follow these steps in a script. If you'd like, I can help by providing a sample code snippet for these operations.
