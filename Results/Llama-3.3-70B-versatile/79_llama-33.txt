('user', "Capture an AFM image of size $\\pu{10000 nm} \times \\pu{10000 nm}$ with the file name '91_GPT-4o'. Open the latest file from the current folder and plot \\pu{1000 nm} length line profile across a distinct step-edge feature and save it as '91_GPT-4o.png'.")

To accomplish the tasks mentioned, we need to break down the request into two main parts: 

1. Capturing an AFM image of the specified size and saving it with the file name '91_GPT-4o'.
2. Opening the latest file from the current folder, plotting a 1000 nm length line profile across a distinct step-edge feature, and saving it as '91_GPT-4o.png'.

Given the roles defined:
- The AFM_Handler is responsible for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine.
- The Data_Handler is implied to be responsible for handling data and image post-processing tasks.

Therefore, the first task should be handled by the AFM_Handler, as it involves capturing an AFM image. After the AFM_Handler completes its task, the Data_Handler should act next to open the file, plot the line profile, and save the plot.

So, the AFM_Handler should act next to capture the AFM image. 

The appropriate choice is: AFM_Handler
