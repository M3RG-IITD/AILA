The retrieved code snippet is related to approaching, withdrawing, or retracting the AFM tip. However, it does not specifically address changing the tip to a different type, such as MULTI75.

To change the tip in an AFM system, a manual process is usually involved, requiring a physical replacement of the cantilever or probe. This process is typically not controlled via software commands.

If you need to physically replace the tip, follow the manufacturer's instructions for safely changing the probe to a MULTI75 type.

If there is anything else you would like to know or if you need further clarification, please let me know!
