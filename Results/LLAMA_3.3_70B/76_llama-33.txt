To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, we need to break down the process into steps that involve different handlers. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Capture an AFM image**: This task involves the AFM_Handler, as it is responsible for controlling the AFM machine and capturing images. The parameters provided (dimensions, scan angle, P gain, I gain, D gain, and setpoint) will be used by the AFM_Handler to capture the image.

2. **Open the latest file in the current folder and extract the Z-axis backward image data**: After the image is captured, the Data_Handler will take over. It will locate the latest file (which should be the image just captured), open it, and extract the relevant data, specifically the Z-axis backward image data.

3. **Calculate the area of the image**: This task also falls under the responsibilities of the Data_Handler, as it involves post-processing of the image data. The Data_Handler will calculate the area based on the extracted data.

Given these steps, the sequence of actions should be:

- First, the **AFM_Handler** should act to capture the AFM image according to the provided parameters.
- Next, the **Data_Handler** should act to open the latest file, extract the Z-axis backward image data, and calculate the area of the image.
- Once all tasks are completed, the response should be **FINISH**.

Therefore, the next step is for the **AFM_Handler** to capture the image.
