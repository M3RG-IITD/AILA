('user', "Acquire an AFM image with dimensions $\\pu{100 nm} \times \\pu{100 nm}$ at a scan angle of $ 5 degrees $, using the following parameters: P gain = 100, I gain = 5000, D gain = 0, and setpoint = 0.1 V. Save the image with the filename 'Test'. Then, open the latest file in the folder, plot the Z-axis forward image, and save the plot as 'Test.png'.")

To accomplish the tasks outlined, we need to break down the request into steps that involve different handlers. Here's how the tasks can be distributed:

1. **Acquire an AFM image**: This task involves capturing an image using the AFM machine. The parameters provided (dimensions, scan angle, P gain, I gain, D gain, and setpoint) are specific to the operation of the AFM machine. Therefore, the **AFM_Handler** should act next to capture the image according to the given parameters and save it with the filename 'Test'.

2. **Open the latest file in the folder, plot the Z-axis forward image, and save the plot as 'Test.png'**: After the image is acquired and saved by the AFM_Handler, the next step involves post-processing of the image, which includes opening the file, plotting the Z-axis forward image, and saving the plot. This task does not involve controlling the AFM machine but rather handling and processing the image data. Therefore, the **Data_Handler** should act next to perform these tasks.

Given the sequence of tasks, the first step is to acquire the AFM image, which is the responsibility of the **AFM_Handler**. 

The appropriate choice is: **AFM_Handler**.
