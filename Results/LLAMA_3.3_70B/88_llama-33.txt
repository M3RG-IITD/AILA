('user', "Open the file 'Sample.nid,' extract the Z-axis backward image data, and plot two line profiles: one vertical and one horizontal across the image. Save the plot as 'question_107.png.'")
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Name: AILA

To accomplish the task, I will assign it to the Data_Handler. The Data_Handler is responsible for handling image after-processing, including extracting data, plotting line profiles, and saving the results.

I will now instruct the Data_Handler to:

1. Open the file 'Sample.nid'
2. Extract the Z-axis backward image data
3. Plot two line profiles: one vertical and one horizontal across the image
4. Save the plot as 'question_107.png'

The Data_Handler will complete these tasks and provide the results and status.

Next, I will wait for the Data_Handler to finish its tasks. 

The next actor should be: Data_Handler

Please let the Data_Handler continue with the task.
