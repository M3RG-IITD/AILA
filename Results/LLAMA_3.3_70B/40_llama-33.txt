To accomplish the task of opening the file 'Sample.nid,' extracting the forward friction force image data, and plotting it, we need to follow a series of steps that involve different handlers. Given the roles defined, the 'Data_Handler' is the most suitable for tasks involving data extraction and manipulation, such as opening files and extracting specific data. The 'AFM_Handler' is limited to capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, which doesn't include data post-processing or plotting. Therefore, the 'Data_Handler' should act next to extract the forward friction force image data from the 'Sample.nid' file.

After the 'Data_Handler' extracts the necessary data, it would then be appropriate for the 'Data_Handler' to also handle the plotting of the extracted data, as this involves data manipulation and visualization, which is beyond the scope of the 'AFM_Handler'. Once the plot is generated and saved as 'question_40.png,' the task would be considered complete.

Thus, the sequence of actions should be:
1. 'Data_Handler' opens the file 'Sample.nid' and extracts the forward friction force image data.
2. 'Data_Handler' plots the extracted data.
3. 'Data_Handler' saves the plot as 'question_40.png.'

Given this analysis, the next step is for the 'Data_Handler' to act.
