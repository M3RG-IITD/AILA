To accomplish the task of opening the file 'Sample.nid', extracting the data corresponding to the Z-axis forward image, and saving it as a single grid image named 'question_28.png', the appropriate next step would involve handling the data within the file. 

Given the roles described, the AFM_Handler is limited to capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, which does not include handling or processing data after it has been captured. Therefore, the AFM_Handler is not the correct choice for this task.

The task requires processing and manipulating the data from the 'Sample.nid' file to extract the Z-axis forward image and then saving it as a PNG image. This involves data handling and image processing, which is beyond the capabilities of the AFM_Handler as described.

Thus, the Data_Handler, which is implied to be capable of handling data and possibly image processing tasks, would be the most appropriate choice to act next. The Data_Handler can open the file, extract the necessary data, and then save it in the required format.

The correct choice is: Data_Handler
