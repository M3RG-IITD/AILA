To accomplish the tasks mentioned, we first need to extract the data corresponding to the Z-axis backward image from the file 'Sample.nid'. This involves handling and processing the image data, which is not within the capabilities of the AFM_Handler as it is exclusively for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine. Therefore, the Data_Handler, which is responsible for image after-processing, should act next.
