To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, we need to follow a series of steps that involve different handlers or assistants within our system. Given the requirements, here's how we can proceed:

1. **Open the file named 'Glass_NAP.nid'**: This task involves accessing and reading data from a specific file. The `Data_Handler` is typically responsible for managing data, including reading files.

2. **Plot the z-axis forward image from that file and save it as 'question_53.png'**: After the file is opened and the data is accessed, plotting the z-axis forward image and saving it as a PNG file involves data processing and visualization. This task can also be managed by the `Data_Handler`, as it often includes capabilities for data manipulation and visualization.

3. **Calculate the corresponding average friction**: Calculating average friction from the data obtained from the file involves analyzing the data, which is again a task suited for the `Data_Handler`.

Given these requirements, the `Data_Handler` should act next to perform these tasks. The `AFM_Handler` is exclusively for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, and it cannot handle image after-processing or data analysis tasks as described.

Therefore, the appropriate choice is `Data_Handler`.
