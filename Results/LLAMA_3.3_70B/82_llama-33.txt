To accomplish the task of opening the file 'Sample.nid', extracting the data corresponding to the Z-axis backward image, plotting a line profile across the image, and saving it as 'question_102.png', we need to follow a series of steps that involve different handlers. 

1. **Data_Handler**: This handler should be used to open the file 'Sample.nid' and extract the relevant data, specifically the Z-axis backward image. The Data_Handler is responsible for managing and processing data, which includes opening files and extracting specific data sets.

2. **AFM_Handler**: Although the AFM_Handler is primarily for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, in some contexts, it might be involved in the initial stages of data processing, especially if the data extraction requires specific AFM-related parameters. However, based on the given information, its role seems limited to machine control and initial image capture.

3. **Data_Handler (again)**: After the data is extracted, the Data_Handler would be responsible for plotting a line profile across the extracted image. This involves data analysis and visualization, which falls under the Data_Handler's responsibilities.

4. **Data_Handler (final step)**: Lastly, saving the plotted line profile as 'question_102.png' is also a task for the Data_Handler, as it involves data output and storage.

Given these steps, the first action should be taken by the **Data_Handler** to open the file and extract the necessary data. 

So, the next step should be: **Data_Handler**.
