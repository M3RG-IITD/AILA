================================== Ai Message ==================================
Name: AILA

To accomplish the tasks mentioned, we need to follow a series of steps that involve different handlers or assistants. Given the requirements, here's how we can proceed:

1. **Open the file 'Sample.nid' and extract the data corresponding to the Z-axis backward image**: This task involves handling data, which suggests the use of the `Data_Handler`. The `Data_Handler` should be able to open the specified file, navigate through its contents, and extract the relevant data for the Z-axis backward image.

2. **Calculate the number of square grids present in the image**: After the data is extracted, this task also falls under data processing, which means the `Data_Handler` is again the appropriate choice. The `Data_Handler` will process the extracted data to determine the number of square grids in the image.

3. **Save the Z-axis backward image as 'question_23.png'**: Saving an image file is also a data handling task. Thus, the `Data_Handler` should perform this action as well.

Given these steps, the `Data_Handler` is the most suitable choice to act next because all the tasks involve data extraction, processing, and saving, which are within its capabilities.

The `AFM_Handler` is mentioned to be exclusively for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine, and it cannot handle image after-processing. Therefore, it is not the appropriate choice for these tasks.

So, the next action should be taken by the `Data_Handler`. 

Selected action: `Data_Handler`
