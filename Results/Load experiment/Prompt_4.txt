The tasks need to be divided among the team members accordingly:

1. **AFM_Handler**: 
   - Set the scan size to $1000 \times 1000 nm$.
   - Set initial setpoint to 0.2V and perform the scan.
   - Increase the setpoint incrementally up to 1.2V and perform scans at each step.

2. **Data_Handler**: 
   - Upon completion of the scanning procedure by AFM_Handler for each setpoint, retrieve the latest files from the folder.
   - Analyze the first image of each scan to determine the average friction value.
   - Once all scans are complete, plot the average friction values as a function of setpoint voltage and save the plot as '20241204_AI-AFM_GPT-4o_S2.png'.

The first step involves setting up the AFM machine and scanning at the initial setpoint, and since AFM_Handler is responsible for operating the machine, AFM_Handler should act next.

I have retrieved the necessary codes to set the scan size to $1000 \times 1000$ nm, adjust the setpoint, and perform scans using the AFM machine. The sequence involves:

1. **Setting the scan size and initial setpoint:**
    - Modify the AFM parameters to set the image scan size and the initial setpoint to 0.2V.
2. **Performing the initial scan with the set parameters.**

Next, I will modify the retrieved code accordingly and execute it to configure the AFM for the initial part of the experiment.

The AFM scan parameters have been successfully set to a size of $1000 \times 1000$ nm, and the initial setpoint was adjusted to 0.2V. The initial scan has been conducted.

**Next Steps for Data_Handler:**
- Retrieve the latest scan file to analyze the image.
- Determine the average friction value from this scan.
- Inform AFM_Handler to proceed with the next setpoint adjustments after analyzing the data.
