================================== Ai Message ==================================
Name: AFM_Handler

It seems we encountered some issues with executing the AFM-related code due to a missing Python package ('pythoncom') and some errors with image processing functions. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Fix the 'pythoncom' Module Issue**: 
   - Ensure that the `pywin32` package is installed in your Python environment. This package includes 'pythoncom' and is necessary for interacting with Windows COM objects.
   - You can install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pywin32
     ```

2. **Re-execute the AFM Control Code**:
   - Once the package is installed, the previous AFM control code should be retried to set the parameters and approach the tip.

3. **Address Image Processing Errors**:
   - Ensure that the images are being saved correctly in the expected directory.
   - Verify that the image processing functions have access to the latest saved files.

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you would like me to proceed with any of the steps mentioned above.
