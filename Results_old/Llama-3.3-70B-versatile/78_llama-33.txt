To accomplish the tasks outlined, we need to follow a sequence of steps that involve capturing an AFM image, extracting the relevant data from the captured image, and then analyzing that data to find the maximum height. Given the roles defined:

1. **AFM_Handler**: Responsible for capturing images and controlling the AFM machine.
2. **Data_Handler**: Presumably responsible for handling data, including opening files, extracting data, and performing calculations on that data.

The sequence of actions should be as follows:

1. **Capture the AFM Image**: The first task is to capture an AFM image with the specified dimensions and parameters. This task falls under the responsibility of the **AFM_Handler**.

2. **Extract Z-axis Forward Image Data and Calculate Maximum Height**: After the image is captured, the next step involves opening the latest file (presumably the captured image), extracting the Z-axis forward image data, and calculating the maximum height of any point in the image. This task involves data handling and analysis, which is best suited for the **Data_Handler**.

Given these considerations, the first action should be to capture the AFM image using the **AFM_Handler**. After the **AFM_Handler** completes its task, the **Data_Handler** should act to open the file, extract the necessary data, and perform the required calculations.

Therefore, the next step should involve the **AFM_Handler** to capture the image as per the given parameters. 

The correct choice is: **AFM_Handler**.
